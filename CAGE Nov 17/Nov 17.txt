Check constraints in training set
Compare graphs used for training and graph used for evaluation
Number of nodes and edges in the two cases of training and testing graphs and are they the same. 
Number of features in example datasets (attributes), and number of attributes supported. 
Methods to find highly variable genes: scanpy package "https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/scanpy.pp.highly_variable_genes.html#scanpy.pp.highly_variable_genes"

Changes made:
1) Load Data: Use self.edge_adj_matrix = np.array(nx.to_numpy_array(self.graph, nodelist=sorted(self.graph.nodes())))


29 Nov:
Try to use CAGE with biological data (single cell data)
Use squidpy package, has some example datasets to test out on (https://squidpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebooks/tutorials/index.html)
Also contains function: https://squidpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebooks/examples/graph/compute_spatial_neighbors.html, use this to build graph of the spatial relationships btw cells
Test out first, see if CAGE can accept, if not then write function to convert into a np array representation that CAGE can accept. 

There are 2 types of ways to implement, coord or visium, https://squidpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/squidpy.gr.spatial_neighbors.html
Attributes: Gene expression data, in the AnnData.X array (Matrix of cell x gene), adata.obsp

Returns
: If copy = True, returns a tuple with the spatial connectivities and distances matrices.

Otherwise, modifies the adata with the following keys:

anndata.AnnData.obsp ['{key_added}_connectivities'] - the spatial connectivities.

anndata.AnnData.obsp ['{key_added}_distances'] - the spatial distances.

anndata.AnnData.uns ['{key_added}'] - dict containing parameters.


Test on data sets: https://squidpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#module-squidpy.datasets
Visium are on a grid, start with the non-visium data sets. 

https://squidpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/squidpy.datasets.seqfish.html#squidpy.datasets.seqfish
Get access to these datasets by loading these functions


Write the function to convert returned anndata graph to one CAGE can analyze. 
What would successful predictions look like? (Answer later)
